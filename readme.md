#Introduction to the argparse lib from the Python Docs

This file contains sample code from the argparse HOWTO that
can be found in the python docs.

It will also contain some of my own notes and thoughts about how
I perceive the argparse library to work

The order to read these files if you're trying to follow along is

1. prog.py
2. prog_positional_args.py
3. optional_args.py
4. boolean_optional_args.py
5. short_option_args.py
6. square_tool.py
7. args_combined_prog.py

More will come to follow as I move along the tutorials
